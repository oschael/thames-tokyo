## Navigation Flow
1. **Hero** → Trust Challenge → Founder Authority → Services Preview → Delicatessen Teaser → Access Stories Preview → Contact
2. **About** → Manifesto → Founder Timeline → Problem/Solution/Execution blocks
3. **Services** → Problem context → Solution pillars → Execution guarantee → Sector expertise
4. **Access Stories** → Case study browser → Full stories → Delicatessen connection
5. **Delicatessen** → Regional explorer → Product access stories → Business sourcing CTA
6. **Contact** → Lead form → Trust reinforcement → Direct contact

## Lead Generation Strategy
- Primary CTA: "Discuss your access challenge" (appears on hero, services, contact)
- Secondary CTA: "Start a confidential conversation" (contact page)
- Product pages: "Discuss sourcing for your business" (delicatessen)
- Newsletter capture: "Access Insights" (delicatessen checkout)

## User Journey Design
1. **Awareness**: Hero establishes premium positioning and access problem
2. **Education**: Trust Challenge explains why this isn't simple sourcing
3. **Trust Building**: Founder authority and modular messaging establish credibility
4. **Solution Understanding**: Services preview shows the cultural interface approach
5. **Proof**: Access Stories demonstrate real outcomes
6. **Taste**: Delicatessen provides tangible quality proof
7. **Conversion**: Contact forms capture qualified leads

## Interactive Elements Constraints
- No traditional e-commerce functionality (no shopping cart, no price filters)
- All interactions must reinforce the brand story and access narrative
- Every product interaction leads to business sourcing inquiry
- Mobile-first design with elegant hover states for desktop
- Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract from content
